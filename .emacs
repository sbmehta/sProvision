; On both vax and rt the function keys emit "ESC [ # ~"
; The keys map to values of "#" as follows:
; F1            11
; ...
; F5            15
; F6            17
; ...
; F10           21
; F11           23      (RT only; this is "escape" on the vax)
; F12 24
; F13           25      (Vax only; no such key on RT)
; F14           26      (Vax only; no such key on RT)

; First, define an empty keymap to hold the bindings
(defvar fnkey-map (make-sparse-keymap) "Keymap for function keys")

; Second, bind it to ESC-[ (which is the prefix used on the function keys.
(define-key esc-map "[" fnkey-map)

; Third, bind functions to the keys.  Note that you must use the internal
; emacs-lisp function names, which are usually, but not always, the same as
; the name used to invoke the command via M-x.

; One key is bound to a non-standard function: "mail-sig".  This ; is a
; keyboard macro I have defined to sign my mail with a single keystroke.
; When a keyboard macro is invoked, the effects are as if you had typed all
; the characters that make up its definition.  To define a keyboard macro,
; do something like this:

(fset 'mail-sig
  " Lois Bennett <lois@athena.mit.edu>")
                                                 
; The "^M" is a control character, type C-q C-m to insert it.
; This macro can be invoked by typing M-x and its name, or with F2.
